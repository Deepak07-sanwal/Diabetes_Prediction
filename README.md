# Diabetes_Prediction

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for the effective management of diabetes and prevention of complications. In this project, we have developed and compared three machine learning models for diabetes prediction: decision tree, XGBoost, random forest and support vector machine (SVM).

We used a dataset consisting of several clinical and demographic features of patients, including age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure, to train and evaluate our models. We preprocessed the data by handling missing values and scaling the features to ensure optimal performance.

Our results showed that all three models performed well in predicting diabetes, with XGBoost outperforming the other two models with an accuracy of 79.0%. The decision tree , random forest and SVM models achieved accuracies of 76.0% , 78.0% and 76.0%, respectively.

Our findings suggest that machine learning models, particularly XGBoost, can be effective tools for diabetes prediction. The models can help healthcare providers identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes and initiate timely interventions to improve patient outcomes.
